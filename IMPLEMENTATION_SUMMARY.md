# Unified Data Structure Implementation

## Files Created

1. **Unified Schema**

   - Created `unifiedSchema.ts` with comprehensive type definitions for all app entities
   - Standardized interfaces for Product, CaseStudy, Certificate, LegalDocument, Contact, User, Order

2. **Data Service**

   - Implemented `dataService.ts` with CRUD operations for all entities
   - Created mock data in `mockData.ts` for development purposes

3. **React Context & Hooks**

   - Created `DataContext.tsx` to provide data throughout the application
   - Implemented specialized hooks for each entity:
     - `useData.ts` - General data access
     - `useProducts.ts` - Product operations
     - `useCaseStudies.ts` - Case Study operations
     - `useCertificates.ts` - Certificate operations
     - `useLegalDocuments.ts` - Legal Document operations
     - `useContacts.ts` - Contact form operations
     - `useCart.ts` - Cart management
     - `useCartContext.ts` - Cart context integration

4. **Application Integration**

   - Updated `App.tsx` to use the new providers
   - Updated `Header.tsx` to use cart context
   - Created example components to demonstrate usage:
     - `ExampleCRUDComponent.tsx` - Basic CRUD operations
     - `ExampleCartComponent.tsx` - Cart operations
     - `DashboardExample.tsx` - Comprehensive dashboard using all hooks

5. **Documentation**
   - Created integration guide: `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Created unified data structure overview: `README_UNIFIED_DATA.md`

## Integration Plan

1. **Replace component-specific data with unified data**

   - Update all components to use appropriate hooks instead of local state
   - Follow the patterns in example components

2. **Implement CRUD UI**

   - Create admin forms for managing all entities
   - Follow the patterns in ExampleCRUDComponent

3. **Connect to Backend**
   - When ready, modify the data service to connect to a real API
   - No changes to components will be required

## Key Benefits

1. **Centralized Data Management**

   - All data flows through a single service
   - Consistent state across the application

2. **Type Safety**

   - Strong TypeScript typing reduces errors
   - Autocomplete and intellisense support

3. **CRUD Ready**

   - All entities have Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
   - Easy to integrate with backend APIs

4. **Extensible Design**

   - New entities can be added by following the pattern
   - Easy to add new operations to existing entities

5. **SEO Support**
   - Metadata fields included for SEO optimization
   - Product and content data structured for search engines
